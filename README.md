# TruHousingAnalytics

**TruHousingAnalytics** is a project focused on providing real-time analysis of housing market data, with the current implementation utilizing the [Rentcast API](https://www.rentcast.io/) for data gathering.

## Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to:
- Fetch and analyze real-time housing data
- Present meaningful insights through a web interface
- Utilize a C# backend for API handling and business logic

This project is being currently being developed as a time-boxed challenge â€” **3 days** of focused development to measure progress and explore rapid prototyping with modern tools.

## Tech Stack (Planned)
- **Backend:** C# (ASP.NET Core)
- **Frontend:** TBD (possibly React, Blazor, or simple HTML/CSS for MVP)
- **Data Source:** Rentcast API

## Timeline
| Day | Focus Area |
|-----|------------|
| 1   | API integration & backend setup |
| 2   | Basic frontend and data visualization |
| 3   | Deployment and final polish |

## Features (Planned)
- Real-time rent estimate fetching
- Historical rent trends
- Neighborhood analytics
- Interactive charts (if time allows)

## Notes
This is an exploratory build meant to test rapid development. Not all features may be complete or polished by the end of the 3-day timeline.
